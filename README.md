This repository is for the project of the course CSC326 (Programming Languages) at University of Toronto. Fall of 2014.
The project consists of a Search Engine. It was coded, mainly, in Python, using the framework Bottle. Using MySQL and Redis for database.
I need to add some features and optimize the actual ones.
